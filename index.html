                <p><span>Welcome! I am 25 years old from Middletown, Delaware. Please refrain from the classic "Dela-where?" jokes. We are very aware of how small of a state we are!</span><br><br> All jokes aside, I graduated from the University of Delaware with a degree in Psychology and a minor in Philosophy, but due to the COVID pandemic, I realized how important flexiblity and freedom can be when choosing a career. So I took the initiative to grow my skill set and learn how to code. Taking the leap was scary and I was filled with uncertainty and doubt. I have always had a passion for the web and technology in general since I was very young. I figured if I wanted to make a change, there is no time better than the present, and I can honestly say it's one of the best decisions I've ever made. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript and JS React. I can also code responsive websites, much like the one you are on now!<br><br> Thank you for checking out my website and I am looking forward to working with you!</p>
