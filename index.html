                          <p class="description">This is a simple website design with 3 main sections (About, Work and Contact). With the help of Skillcrush, I was able to practice the HTML and CSS lessons I learned and I began buiding confidence in my ability to code.</p>

                          <p class="description">This was the second project I worked on and despite the simplicity of the page itself, I had to learn how to incorporate new design styles. It took some time but by the end I was feeling comfortable with my new skills.</p>

                        <p class="description">This was my third project I completed and quite honestly my favorite out of the three. CSS had been an area I struggled with and this project was the perfect way to practice. I went into this project a little fearful of CSS but by the end I felt ultra confident in my abilities.</p>

                <p><span>I am 24 years old from Middletown, Delaware. Please refrain from the classic "Dela-where?" jokes. We are very aware of how small of a state we are!</span><br><br> All jokes aside, I graduated from the University of Delaware with a degree in Psychology, but due to the COVID pandemic, I realized how important flexiblity and freedom can be when choosing a career. So I decided to grow my skill set and learn how to code. Taking the leap was scary, and I was filled with uncertainty, but I knew it was something I had to do. I have always had a passion for the web and technology in general since I was very young. I figured if I wanted to make a change, there is no time better than the present, and I can honestly say it's one of the best decisions I've ever made. Thanks to Skillcrush, I feel that I have the skillset and confidence needed to succeed in the tech field.<br><br> Thank you for checking out my website and I am looking forward to working with you!</p>
